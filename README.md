Crossplatform Language Interoperable Bytecode Target for Crossplatform Desktop Applications

UASM Bytecode can be packaged into .orb (Open Runtime Binary) files, which function similarly to .jar files. Unlike traditional executables, .orb files are completely platform-independent. When executed, the runtime compiles them on the host system, producing optimized native code. Libraries included within the .orb are compiled into native dynamic libraries, allowing seamless integration with the users system.
